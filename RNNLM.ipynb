    "### Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a [Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) using a Recurrent Neural Network. Here's what that means. Let's say we have sentence  of $m$ words. Language Model allows us to predict probability of observing that sentence (in a given dataset) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "P(w_1,...,w_m) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m}P(w_i \\mid w_1,..., w_{i-1}) \n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the probability of a sentence is the product of probabilities of each word given the words that came before it. So, the probability of the sentence \"He went to buy some chocolate\" would be the probability of \"chocolate\" given \"He went to buy some\", multiplied by the probability of \"some\" given \"He went to buy\", and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that useful? Why would we want to assign a probability to observing a sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, such a model can be used as a scoring mechanism. For example, a Machine Translation typically generates multiple candidates for the translations of a sentence. You could use a language model to pick the most probable sentence. Intuitively, the most probable sentence is likely to be grammatically correct. Similar scoring happens in speech recognition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But solving the Language Modeling problem also has a cool side effect. Because we can predict the probability of a word given the preceding words, we are able to generate new text. It's a *generative model*. Given an existing sequence of words we sample a next word from the predicted probabilities, and repeat the process until we have a full sentence. Andrew Karparthy [has a great post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) that demonstrates what languages models are capable of. His models are trained on single characters as opposed to full words, and can generate anything from Shakespeare to Linux Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above equation the probability of each word is conditioned on **all** previous words. In practice, many models have a hard time representing such long-term dependencies due to computational or memory constraints. They are typically limited to looking at only a few of the previous words. RNNs can, in theory, capture such long-term dependencies, but in practice it's a bit more complex. We'll explore that in a later post."

    "### Training Data and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our language model we need text to learn from. Fortunately we don't need any labels to train a language model, just raw text. I downloaded 15,000 longish reddit comments from a [dataset available on Google's BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2015_08). Text generated by our model will sound like reddit commenters (hopefully)! But as with most Machine Learning projects we first need to do some pre-processing to get our data into the right format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Tokenize Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We have raw text, but we want to make predictions on a per-word basis. This means we must *tokenize* our comments into sentences, and sentences into words. We could just split each of the comments by spaces, but that wouldn't handle punctuation properly. The sentence \"He left!\" should be 3 tokens: \"He\", \"left\", \"!\". We'll use [NLTK's](http://www.nltk.org/) `word_tokenize` and `sent_tokenize` methods, which do most of the hard work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Remove infrequent words\n",
    "\n",
    "Most words in our text will only appear one or two times. It's a good idea to remove these infrequent words. Having a huge vocabulary will make our model slow to train (we'll talk about why that is later), and because we don't have a lot of contextual examples for such words we wouldn't be able to learn how to use them correctly anyway. That's quite similar to how humans learn. To really understand how to appropriately use a word you need to have seen it in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code we limit our vocabulary to the `vocabulary_size` most common words (which I set to 2500, but feel free to change it). We replace all words not included in our vocabulary by `UNKNOWN_TOKEN`. For example, if we don't include the word \"nonlinearities\" in our vocabulary the sentence \"nonlineraties are important in neural networks\" becomes \"UNKNOWN_TOKEN are important in Neural Networks\". The word `UNKNOWN_TOKEN` will become part of our vocabulary and we will predict it just like any other word. When we generate new text we can replace `UNKNOWN_TOKEN` again, for example by taking a randomly sampled word not in our vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Prepend special start and end tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to learn which words tend start and end a sentence. To do this we prepend a special `SENTENCE_START` token, and append a special `SENTENCE_END` token to each sentence. This allows us to ask: Given that the first token is `SENTENCE_START`, what is the likely next word (the actual first word of the sentence)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Build training data matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to our Recurrent Neural Networks are vectors, not strings. So we create a mapping between words and indices, `index_to_word`, and `word_to_index`. For example,  the word \"friendly\" may be at index 2001. A training example $x$ may look like `[0, 179, 341, 416]`, where 0 corresponds to `SENTENCE_START`. The corresponding label $y$ would be `[179, 341, 416, 1]`. Remember that our goal is to predict the next word, so y is just the x vector shifted by one position with the last element being the `SENTENCE_END` token. In other words, the correct prediction for word `179` above would be `341`, the actual next word."

    "#### Building the RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general overview of RNNs take a look at [first part of the tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/).\n",

    "![](http://www.wildml.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rnn.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get concrete and see what the RNN for our language model looks like. The input $x$ will be a sequence of words (just like the example printed above) and each $x_i$ is a single word. But there's one more thing: Because of how matrix multiplication works we can't simply use a word index (like 36) as an input. Instead, we represent each word as a *one-hot vector* of size `vocabulary_size`. For example, the word with index 36 would be the vector of all 0's and a 1 at position 36. So, each $x_i$ will become a vector, and $x$ will be a matrix, with each row representing a word. We'll perform this transformation in our Neural Network code instead of doing it in the pre-processing. The output of our network $o$ has a similar format. Each $o_t$ is a vector of `vocabulary_size` elements, and each element represents the probability of that word being the next word in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the equations for the RNN from the first part of the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "s_t &= \\tanh(Ux_t + Ws_{t-1}) \\\\\n",
    "o_t &= \\mathrm{softmax}(Vs_t)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "I always find it useful to write down the dimensions of the matrices and vectors. Let's assume we pick a vocabulary size $C = 2500$ and a hidden layer size $H = 200$. You can think of the hidden layer size as the \"memory\" of our network. Making it bigger allows us to learn more complex patterns, but also results in additional computation. Then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "x_t & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2500} \\\\\n",
    "o_t & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2500} \\\\\n",
    "s_t & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{200} \\\\\n",
    "U & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{200 \\times 2500} \\\\\n",
    "V & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2500 \\times 200} \\\\\n",
    "W & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{200 \\times 200} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is valuable information. Remember that $U,V$ and $W$ are the parameters of our network we want to learn from data. Thus, we need to learn a total of $2HC + H^2$ parameters. In the case of $C=2500$ and $H=200$ that's 1,040,000.  The dimensions also tell us the bottleneck of our model. Note that because $x_t$ is a one-hot vector, multiplying it with $U$ is essentially the same as selecting a column of U, so we don't need to perform the full multiplication. Then, the biggest matrix multiplication in our network is $Vs_t$. That's why we want to keep our vocabulary size small if possible.\n",

    "We start by declaring a RNN class an initializing our parameters. I'm calling this class `RNNNumpy` because we will implement a Theano version later. Initializing the parameters $U,V$ and $W$ is a bit tricky. We can't just initialize them to 0's because that would result in symmetric calculations in all our layers. We must initialize them randomly. Because proper initialization seems to have an impact on training results there has been lot of research in this area. It turns out that the best initialization depends on the activation function ($\\tanh$ in our case) and one [recommended](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) approach is to initialize the weights randomly in the interval from $\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right]$ where $n$ is the number of incoming connections from the previous layer. This may sound overly complicated, but don't worry too much about it. As long as you initialize your parameters to small random values it typically works out fine."

    "#### Training the RNN with SGD and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we want to find the parameters $U,V$ and $W$ that minimize the total loss on the training data. The most common way to do this is SGD, Stochastic Gradient Descent. The idea behind SGD is pretty simple. We iterate over all our training examples and during each iteration we nudge the parameters into a direction that reduces the error. These directions are given by the gradients on the loss: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial U}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W}$. SGD also needs a *learning rate*, which defines how big of a step we want to make in each iteration. SGD is the most popular optimization method not only for Neural Networks, but also for many other Machine Learning algorithms. As such there has been a lot of research on how to optimize SGD using batching, parallelism and adaptive learning rates. Even though the basic idea is simple, implementing SGD in a really efficient way can become very complex. If you want to learn more about SGD [this](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/) is a good place to start. Due to its popularity there are a wealth of tutorials floating around the web, and I don't want to duplicate them here. I'll implement a simple version of SGD that should be understandable even without a background in optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we calculate those gradients we mentioned above? In a [traditional Neural Network](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/) we do this through the backpropagation algorithm. In RNNs we use a slightly modified version of the this algorithm called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). Because the parameters are shared by all time steps in the network, the gradient at each output depends not only on the calculations of the current time step, but also the previous time steps. If you know calculus, it really is just applying the chain rule. The next part of the tutorial will be all about BPTT, so I won't go into detailed derivation here. For a general introduction to backpropagation check out [this](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) and this [post](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/). For now you can treat BPTT as a black box. It takes as input a training example $(x,y)$ and returns the gradients $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial U}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W}$."

I defined a `RNNTheano` class that replaces the numpy calculations with corresponding calculations in Theano. Just like the rest of this post, [the code is also available Github](https://github.com/dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-rnnlm)."
